# podcast
a podcast server for ksdt

## status
working

## installation

- add users in new file `.pass`
 - lines should be of the form: user pass
  - that's user(space)pass

## usage

start with `node index.js`

## how it works
users visit / and update their podcast information, or upload a new episode. the node server drops the information in a file in public/podcasts/<user>

then when a client requests /rss/<user>, the node server generates the xml from the file structure.
